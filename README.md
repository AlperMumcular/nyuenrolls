If u havent run the project yet on your local using latest pc, delete all the migrations u had until now, run makemigrations, now u have two migrations for courseEnroll and one for userprofile. Run a fake migration "Python manage.py migrate courseEnroll "2nd Migration name" --fake. So now the issue of department_id is resolved.
