This is enhanced version existing NYU Course Enrollment Application "Albert". We have implemented a priority-based waitlisting system and fixed other bugs that are present.

A few things to understand, a student has 100 points that he can divide among waitlisted courses, and using a combination of points and the day waitlisting was done, the rank of a student of waitlisting is done. Enrollment into full classes is open to students in the waitlist in this order.
